    1) First argument is required.
    2) Second argument is optional.

Valid first argument commands are:
    1) {}: command to add a shortcut to the current directory.
        If a second argument is given, that argument is the name that will
        be used to refer to the shortcut for future use.
        If no second argument is given, the high level name will be used.
    2) {} or {}: command to list the current shortcuts and their names.
    3) {} or {}: both commands to show current hop version info.
    4) {}: command to create a temporary shortcut to the current directory
        that can be jumped back to using the {} {} command.
    5) {} or {}: command to remove the shortcut specified by {}.
    6) {}: open a file or directory within your editor of choice.
    7) {} or {}: open your bunnyhop configuration file.
    8) {}: show all relevant installation directories if no second argument
        is given.  If second argument is given, list the full path to the given
        argument.
    10) {}: Any other first arguments given will be checked to see if it
        represents a valid directory/file to hop to.  This input can be a named
        shortcut, a file/directory in the current directory, or a file/directory
        from previous {} commands.
